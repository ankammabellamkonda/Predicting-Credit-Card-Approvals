# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Commercial banks process numerous credit card applications and often need to reject them. In this project, we'll use supervised machine learning techniques to automate this process, making it an efficient and cost-effective solution for banks.
we are doing Preproccessing data and apply supervised learning techniques to find the best model and parameters for the job. And also save the accuracy score from your best model as a numeric variable, best_score. we are aiming for the accuracy score of at least 0.75.

Approach of the project : 
1. Preprocess the data
2. Prepare the data for modeling
3. Train the model
4. Finding the best scoring model
